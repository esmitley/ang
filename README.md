Name of project:	:eyes: Ang



What was learned:	:hatching_chick:  still hatching

What was difficult: :bell:	gitignore
There are a number of different types of git ignore files. They are used at different times, in different places, in different ways. Just researching the word doesn't explain which to use, when to use it, or how to use it.


Why are .gitignore files important? :whale2::dash: whump!
Because the 2000 plus file extentions make a huge mess in the folders when you don't hide them, and and you can't back track very well.
